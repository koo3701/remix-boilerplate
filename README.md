# Welcome to Remix!

- ðŸ“– [Remix docs](https://remix.run/docs)

## Development

Run the dev server:

```shellscript
pnpm run dev
```

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
pnpm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
pnpm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `pnpm run build`

- `build/server`
- `build/client`

## Styling

This template comes with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) already configured for a simple default starting experience. You can use whatever css framework you prefer. See the [Vite docs on css](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#css) for more information.

## Storybook

You can use Storybook to develop and test your components.

### Running Storybook

To start the Storybook development server, run the following command:

```sh
pnpm run storybook
```

### Building Storybook

To build Storybook as a static site, run the following command:

```sh
pnpm run build-storybook
```

The built files will be output to the `storybook-static` directory.
